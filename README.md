You're going to help a meteorologist produce their weather graphics for the week. Write
a program that will accept the input of daily temperatures (one for each day of the week)
from the console. After input, the program must do the following:
 Display each temperature and the day of the week entered
 Display the average temperature
 Display the hi temperature and day of the week
 Display the low temperature and day of the week
 Use Javadoc for commenting/documenting all methods


 Assume that the user does not know the program’s purpose and will use the
keyboard for input.
 Display sufficient information on the console so that the user
o knows what the program is supposed to do
o is able to correctly enter any needed input
o understands the meaning of the output
